# mvp_marketplace
This repository is an idea for a system of system marketplace mobile app that will eventually target any industry. The inital MVP
is for an agricultural (farmers) marketplace where a buyer searches for requirement and the app send the best match based on criteria
like price, distance, transport availibility etc. This MVP is being targetted in India where the farmers do no have good internet
connection. The app also integrates with transport companies (Uber, Ola etc) and agrees payment terms with the buyer.
Eventually, this app will be used in insurance, commercial products etc.

The app is currently written in Python and JS- React, Django, PostgreSQL.
